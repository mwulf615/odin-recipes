        <p>Plus, there's no funny ingredients, no chilling, etc. Just a simple, straightforward, amazingly delicious, doughy yet still fully cooked, chocolate chip cookie that turns out perfectly every single time!</p>
        <p>These are everything a chocolate chip cookie should be. Crispy and chewy. Doughy yet fully baked. Perfectly buttery and sweet.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Butter.</strong>I use salted butter, but unsalted butter would also be great. I just recommend tasting the dough to ensure that it's salted to your liking.</li>
            <li><strong>White Sugar.</strong> You can use granulated white sugar or organic cane sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown Sugar.</strong> I use light brown sugar in this recipe for the best results.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour.</strong> I recommend using an unbleached, all-purpose flour to make these cookies. Many readers have used gluten-free all-purpose flour with excellent results.</li>
            <li><strong>Sea Salt.</strong> Sea salt is different that table salt, so if you use salt other than sea salt I recommend testing the recipe first with 1/2 tsp and then adjusting to your taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong>Sometimes I use chocolate chunks, chopped chocolate, or chocolate chips. It doesn't matter what you use, and long as you use 2 cups.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h2>Making the Cookie Dough</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl.</li>
            <li>Creame together the butter and sugars. It helps to soften the butter beforehand.</li>
            <li>Once the butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs, and vanilla and beat to combine.</li>
            <li>Add in the dry ingredients and stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Add in the chocolate chips until even distrubuted throughtout the dough.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Portion & Bake</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I <em>highly</em> recommend using a cookie scoop to portion the dough instead of eyeballing.</li>
            <li>Scoop each portion and place roll the portion into a ball.</li>
            <li>Place each ball evenly apart on a baking sheet. (About 1.5 to 2 inches aprts)</li>
            <li>Bake at <strong>375</strong> degress for <strong>8 - 10</strong> minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow the cookes to rest for a few minutes.</li>
        </ol>
